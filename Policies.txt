Policies

1. Access Control Policies
	VLAN 10 (Students)
		- Access internal learning resources
		- No access to administrative or critical network devices
		- Communicate within VLAN 10 but no access to VLAN 20 or 30
		- Potentially restricted internet access if implemented
	VLAN 20 (Faculty/Staff)
		- Access student VLAN for teaching-related purposes
		- Access internal admin resources but not network infrastructure
		- Unrestricted internet access
	VLAN 30 (Admin/IT Staff)
		- Full network access (VLANs, Routers, firewalls)
		- Control policies for all VLANs
		- Configure DHCP, routing and firewall policies
		- Admins get logged out after 15 mins of inactivity (if implemented)

		
2. Addressing Policies
	DHCP Server Implementation
		VLAN 10 - Students get IPs dynamically (192.168.10.0/24) (End Devices)
		VLAN 20 - Staff get IPs dynamically (192.168.20.0/24) (End Devices)
		VLAN 30 - Admins get IPs dynamically (192.168.30.0/24) (End Devices)
		
3. Internet Access Policies
	Students
		Restricted access to external sites
		Allowed access to whitelisted educational resources
	Staff
		Unrestricted access but monitored for security threats
	Admins
		Full access (SSH/VPN access for remote administration)
	
4. Inter-VLAN Routing
	ACLs restrict communication where necessary (10 cant initiate communication with 30)
	
	
5. Address Allocation & Firewalls
	Firewalls
		Block unauthorised access between VLANs (10->30)
		Restrict external connections from student VLANs
		Log and monitor access attempts
	Encryption & Secure Access Policy
		TLS Encryption for gRPC communication
	Logging/Monitoring
		Enable telemetry for monitoring latency and bandwidth
